# 0x00. C - Hello, World
In this lesson, we were introduced to the C Programming Language.

We learned about the history of the C Programming Language, about [Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/YWFrRob_-Yo-_NQikMLI-g), the creator of the language and about [Linus Torvalds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who created the Linux Kernel.
