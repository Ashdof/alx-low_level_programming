# 0x0C. C - More Malloc, Free
In the second part of memory allocation lesson, we dived deeper into the concepts of allocating space in memory. We discovered the necessity of not casting when allocating space with **malloc()** function from stackoverflow.

Again, we did more practicals by even coding some of the memory allocation functions such as **malloc()**, **calloc()** and **realloc()**.
