# 0x07. C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings
In this lesson, we had the opportunity to learn and practice with double pointers *(pointer to pointer)* and multi-dimensional arrays. 

While a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable, a double pointer variable stores the address of another pointer.
