# 0x07. C - Even More Pointers, Arrays and Strings
In this lesson, we had the opportunity to learn and practice with double pointers *(pointer to pointer)* and multi-dimensional arrays. 

While a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable, a double pointer variable stores the address of another pointer.

## General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Define pointers to pointers and how to use them
- Explain multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- Identify the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
