# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation
In this lesson of our low level programming adventure, we were introduced to **bit manipulation.**

## Bit Manipulation
This is a low level operation that is very useful for writting:
- Systems programs. Example *compilers and operating systems*
- Encription programs
- Graphics applications
- Programs for which fast execution and/or efficient use of space is critical

## General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Look for the right source of information without too much help
- Manipulate bits and use **bitwise operators**
