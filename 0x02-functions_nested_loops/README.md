# 0x02. C - Functions, Nested Loops
In the third lesson of low level programming, we learned about functions, loops and nested loops.

## General Objectives
The objectives of the lesson include:
- Meaning of nested loops and how to use them
- What are functions and how to use them
- Know the difference between declaration and definition of a function
- Meaning of function prototypes
- Meaning of the scope of a variable
- What are header files and how to use them with the *#include* directive
- What are the GCC flags *-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89*

Also, we applied the knowledge acquired from previous lessons and this greatly enhanced my understanding of the programming language.
