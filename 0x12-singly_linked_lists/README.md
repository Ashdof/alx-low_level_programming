# 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists
Immediately after the mind-boggling [printf project](https://github.com/Ashdof/printf), came lessons on **Data Structures.** In this lesson, we focused on the easy-to-use **singly linked list**, which is a chain-like data structure.

## Data Structures
These are the various ways of organising data in order to efficiently create, store, find and use data depending on the tasks at hand. Some examples of data structures include *linked lists, trees, maps, stacks, queues* etc.

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a *linear data structure* consisting of a chain of structures, called *nodes*, with each node containing a pointer to the next node in the chain. Linked lists are dynamic data structures which can grow and shrink as the program is running. Common types of linked lists include *singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked lists*.

## Singly Linked List
It is a list containing nodes with data field and a next field which points to the next node in a line of nodes. Some common operations performed on singly linked lists are *insertion, deletion and traversing* of nodes.

## Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Define the following terms: *data structures, linked lists, singly linked list*
- Identify some common data structures and linked lists
- Identified the applications of linked lists
- Conceptualise when and why to use linked lists versus *arrays*
- Create and use linked lists in our programs
