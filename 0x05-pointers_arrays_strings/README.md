# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings
In the fifth lesson on low level programming, we were introduced to Arrays, Pointers and Strings.

### Arrays
An array is a data structure containing a number of data values all of which have the same type. The values in the array are known as elements. These elements are indexed, starting from zero. An example of an array of type integer with 30 elements is, **int scores[30];**

### Pointers
A pointer is simply the address of a variable. A **pointer variable** is a variable that can hold the address of another variable. A pointer variable is declared with the indirection operator, asterick *

### Strings
A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes. An example is, **"C is fun!"**
