# 0x0A. C - Argc, Argv
In this lesson of low level programming, we learned about argc and argv. These are collectively known as command-line arguments.

**Command-line arguments** are information we supply to programs when they are ran. 

**argc**
This means argument count. It is the number of command-line arguments, including the program name.

**argv**
This means argument vector. It is an array of pointers to the command-line arguments which are stored in string format. 

## General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to
- Describe how to use arguments passed to your program
- State the two prototypes of main that we know of, and in which case we can use one or the other
- Explain how to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
