# 0x08. C - Recursion
In lesson eight of the low level programming, we learned recursion. Recursion is a technique in which a block of code calls itself several times. In recursion, there always must be a way to break out of the recursive calls or else it will lead to an infinite loop.

## General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Explain what recursion is
- Demonstrate how to implement recursion
- Identified situations in which recursion can be implemented
- Describe situations which did not favour the implementation of recursion
