# 0x09. C - Static Libraries
In the nineth lesson of the low level programming, we learned about static libraries.

**Library**
A library is a collection of code routines (functions, classes, variables etc.) that can be called upon when building a program. 

**Static Library**
A static library is a library file containing a collection of object files (.o) that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation and are not relevant during runtime.

## General Objects
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Define a static library, describe how it work, how to create one, and how to use it.
- State the basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm
