# 0x0F. C - Function Pointers
In this lesson of low level programming, we explored function pointers. This concept builds on the knowledge acquired on functions and pointers. It is therefore crucial for learners to have a solid understanding of these concepts before proceeding with this lesson.

**Function** pointers are pointer variables that store the address of functions in memory, or *they are variables that point to locations in memory occupied by functions.*

Function pointers can be thought of as **arrays.** Assume *data* is the name of an array. *data[i]* will refer to an element in the array. *data* by itself serves as a pointer to the array.

Similarly, **C** treats a function with its arguments *sum(a, b)* as a call to the function. The C compiler will copy the function's definition and execute it. On the other hand, **C** treats a function without its arguments *sum* as a pointer to the function.

## General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to
- Explain function pointers
- Describe how to use function pointers
- Identify what a function pointer holds
- State where a function pointer points to in the virtual memory
