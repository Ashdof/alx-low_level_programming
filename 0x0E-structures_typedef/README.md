# 0x0E. C - Structures, Typedef
In the fifteenth lesson on low level programming with C, we learned about structures and type definition

### Structure
A structure  is a collection of values or members, possible of different types. A structure represents a new scope. This implies that every structure has a separate name space for its members

### Type Definition
The **typedef** can be used to define a new type for a structure.

# General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Define structures
- Identify when, why and how to use structures
- Practice using **typedef**
