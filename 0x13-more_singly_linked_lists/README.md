# 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists
In the next lesson on data structures and algorithms, we dived deeper into **Singly Linked Lists.** This lesson placed greater emphasize on practicals as we did more coding tasks than any of the projects we have done so far, with the exception of the [printf pair project]().

## Concepts
The concept for this lesson:
- [Data Structures](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/120)

## Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Revised the previous project to refresh our understanding of the underlying concepts.
- Use linked lists in accomplishing various tasks.
- Identify the right source of information for any given tasks with too much help
